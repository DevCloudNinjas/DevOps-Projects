## 🛡️ 2026 DevSecOps Enhancements (What You Will Learn)
This project enforces the DevSecOps principle of **Environment Isolation**. Rather than deploying all stages (Dev, Pre-Prod, Prod) into a single VPC, modern 2026 architectures mandate strict separation using separate VPCs or, ideally, entirely separate AWS Accounts governed by AWS Organizations. This guarantees that a breach in the Dev environment cannot pivot laterally into Production.
