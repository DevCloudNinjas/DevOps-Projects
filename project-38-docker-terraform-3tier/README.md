      ------------------------------------------
      |  Terraform will create below resources |
      ------------------------------------------

      > VPC
      > Application Load Balancer
      > Public & Private Subnets
      > EC2 instances
      > RDS instance
      > Route Table
      > Internet Gateway
      > Security Groups for Web & RDS instances
      > Route Table

      ---------------------------------
      | Instructions to apply changes |
      ---------------------------------

      > terraform init is to initialize the working directory and downloading plugins of the provider
      > terraform plan is to create the execution plan for our code
      > terraform apply is to create the actual infrastructure. It will ask you to provide the Access Key and Secret Key in order to create the infrastructure. So, instead of hardcoding the Access Key and Secret Key, it is better to apply at the run time

```


##  ⇥ Task Info

```
I am going to talk about how to do a classic 3-tier architecture using docker containers and setup infrastructure using terraform
    The 3-tiers will be:

 → Frontend tier: This will host the web application.
 → Middle tier: This will host the api, in our case the REST api.
 → Database tier: This will host the database.
 ```

##  ⇥ Task Conditions 

```
We want to expose the web application to the outside world. 
Simultaneously, we want this layer to be able to talk with the middle tier only not the database tier.

The middle tier will be able to talk with the database only.
```

##  ⇥ Task Documentation 

```
* We are going to build a web application that will display a list of countries and their capitals in a plain old html table. 
* This applications is going to get this data from a rest api which in turn will fetch it from a postgresql database. 
* Its a dead simple app partitioned into 3-tiers. We are going to build the webapp and the rest api in node. 
* Note that this is not going to be a primer on node apps. I assume that the reader is comfortable with creating node webapps.

###  ⇥ Application

```
→ We are going to build a web application that will display a list of countries and their capitals in a plain old html table. 
→ This applications is going to get this data from a rest api which in turn will fetch it from a postgresql database. 
→ Its a dead simple app partitioned into 3-tiers.
```

###  ⇥ Database Tier

We first create the table structure to hold the data. Here is the table:
```
create table country_and_capitals (
  country text,
  capital text
);
```
We are not bothered about primary key and other things right now to keep it simple.

###  ⇥ Middle Tier

The middle tier is going to be simple node app. I have used the express framework. Here it goes …
```
const express = require('express');
const {
    Pool,
    Client
} = require('pg');
const app = express();
const port = 3001;

const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.CONNECTION_STRING
});

app.get('/data', function(req, res) {
    pool.query('SELECT country, capital from country_and_capitals', [], (err, result) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.status(405).jsonp({
                error: err
            });
        }

        return res.status(200).jsonp({
            data: result.rows
        });

    });
});

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Backend rest api listening on port ${port}!`))
```
Its a simple app listening on port 3001. 
We are using express and pg packages. 
You will have to install them.

Now that we have our app, we proceed to containerise it. Here goes the `Dockerfile` for this app.
```
FROM node:17-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3001
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
```

You can test this out by issuing the following commands:
```
$ docker build . 
```

This will build the image. To check:
```
$ docker image ls
```

Run the app, we map the machine’s 3001 port to the container’s 3001 using `-p`:
```
$ docker run -p 3001:3001 api
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3001/data`. You should see a json response like this:
```
JSON will go here
```

###  ⇥ Frontend Tier

The frontend will be again a simple node webapp. Here is the code.
```
const express = require('express');
const request = require('request');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;
const restApiUrl = process.env.API_URL;

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    request(
        restApiUrl, {
            method: "GET",
        },
        function(err, resp, body) {
            if (!err && resp.statusCode === 200) {
                var objData = JSON.parse(body);
                var c_cap = objData.data;
                var responseString = `<table border="1"><tr><td>Country</td><td>Capital</td></tr>`;

                for (var i = 0; i < c_cap.length; i++)
                    responseString = responseString +
                      `<tr><td>${c_cap[i].country}</td><td>${c_cap[i].capital}</td></tr>`;

                responseString = responseString + `</table>`;
                res.send(responseString);
            } else {
                console.log(err);
            }
        });
});

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Frontend app listening on port ${port}!`))
```

This app is calling the REST api we created earlier using request package and displaying the data as a table. The api url is taken from a environment variable. The Dockerfile for this app is exactly the same from the middle tier but for the port. We are using the port 3000.
```
FROM node:10-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3001
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
```

###  ⇥ Putting this together

We are going to run these two containers and a postgresql database container using `docker-compose`. Note that docker-compose is a separate tool that needs to be installed separately. This tool works with docker to orchestrate containers and services.

For this demonstration, we are going to use this folder structure:
```
|
+---frontend
|     +--index.js
|     +--package.json
|     +--package-json.lock
|     +--Dockerfile
+---backend
|    +--index.js
|    +--package.json
|    +--package-json.lock
|    +--Dockerfile
+---init_sql_scripts
|     +--init.sql
+--.dockerignore
+--docker-compose.yml
```

* frontend: has the frontend code and its Dockerfile.
* backend: has the api code and its Dockerfile
* init_sql_scripts: has the sql scripts to populate the database.
* .dockerignore: similar to .gitignore, has entries that the docker will ignore when creating the images.

Here is the `docker-compose.yml` file.
```
version: "3.7"

services:
  api:
    build: ./backend
    environment:
      - CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://demo_user:demo_user@db/demo_db
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - network-backend
      - network-frontend

  webapp:
    build: ./frontend
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://api:3001/data
    depends_on:
      - api
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - network-frontend

  db:
    image: postgres:11.2-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: demo_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: demo_user
      POSTGRES_DB: demo_db
    volumes:
      - ./init_sql_scripts/:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    networks:
      - network-backend

networks:
  network-backend:
  network-frontend:
  ```
 We have three services here, `api`, `webapp` and `db`. We will look at these one by one.
 
 Now that we have the `docker-compose.yml` done. We run it.
 ```
 $ docker-compose up --build
 ```
 Here is what you will probably see on the terminal:
 ```
 docker@mc:~/projects/docker-frontend-backend-db$ docker-compose up --build
