# Cybersecurity Project: Text Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting information into a hash code or a cipher, to prevent unauthorized access by adversaries. The authorized user would access the content via secure keys and validation measures. As a beginner, you can start with a cyber security project on text encryption. This project would help you break down the structure of algorithms like Caesar Cipher, Vigenere Cipher, Railfence Cipher, Autokey Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Beaufort Cipher, etc.

You can build a simple web application to encrypt and decrypt textual information that the user keys in. Remember that strong encryption should produce different outputs even given the same input.

The technology used in the example: are Node.js and JavaScript.
